Multi-purpose Device Server (MDS) is intended as a framework to virtualize 
devices and especially their individual functions. It was initially designed
to control DMX (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMX512-A) devices over a network.

In its current state the core functionality is provided and it has a working 
network protocol. Further development will go into various code improvements
and more controller and user interfaces.
